pyelasticsearch
===============

APN version of `pyelasticsearch-0.0.5` (*as of 20150107*).

The reason this repository exists is to package up an existing version of pyelasticsearch that is used by APN
where the original package (*Python source packages*) cannot be found.

This repository contains:

* A built RPM of `pyelasticsearch-0.0.5` used by current APN system(s) (*20150107*).
* A Tarball of the above RPM.
* A copy of `pyelasticsearch.py` and a new `setup.py` from the above archives (**verbatim**).
* A built Python Wheel of the new `pyelasticsearch-0.0.5`.
